### Projects

###### Academic:

* **Portable aid system for the visually impaired:** Developed a portable device for my thesis, aimed at serving as an audio-visual system for blind-aid using deep learning. The work has been manifested into a patent, and the final application has been submitted and is currently under review (Ref. No.: 201721029585).

* **FreeBSD thread scheduling & memory management:** Designed a FreeBSD kernel thread scheduling algorithm for improved context switching and memory management, for my third year research.

* **PC specification compatibility system:** Developed a PCPartPicker inspired application to assist users in building a computer system using K-nearest neighbors. The frontend featured a Swing-based desktop client and an android application.

* **Appointment management system:** Implemented an interactive hospital appointment scheduling and management system using Bootstrap, JavaScript, Python and SQL.

* **NoSQL injection tool:** Worked on an injection tool to demonstrate a NoSQL attack using VueJS application, ExpressJS server, axios HTTP client and MongoDB.

###### Personal:

The following list in inexhaustive and unordered. For more, check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/Thunderbottom).

* **UltimateBrowserProject:** An open-source android web browser based on WebView. Over 100,000 downloads on XDA forums and 60,000 concurrent sessions in April 2015.

* **GitSync:** Python script to lazy-sync and update all local and remote git repositories.

* **Android Kernel Updater:** Open-source root-based application for updating custom kernel builds for Android.

* **Transpy**: A flask web app to demonstrate loss in translation using Google Translate API.

### Extra-curriculars and Responsibilities

* **Coursera Stanford Machine Learning** certification.

* **Coursera deeplearning.ai Deep Learning** specialization.

* Conducted talks on UNIX based systems at Watumull institute.

* Conducted workshops for web development and machine learning at the Institute of Chemical Technology (ICT) and Watumull Institute.

* Actively maintaining a fork for the Linux Kernel with custom patches.
