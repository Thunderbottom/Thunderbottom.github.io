title: About Me
---

Hey there! I'm Chinmay Pai. I'm from Mumbai, India, and I'm passionate about *nix, open source, privacy, and system infrastructure. This is a good place to start if you want to learn more about me.

I have been working as a professional DevOps and Security Engineer for the past couple of years. In that time span I have worked on a variety of problems ranging from server management and orchestration, to enhancing the security and monitoring infrastructure. I currently work as a DevOps and Security Engineer at Frappe.

In my free time I try to learn new things, play videogames, read, and occasionally compose music. This is my personal blog unaffiliated to the company I work for. Over time, this space will be filled with articles that concern my interests and musings. If you wish to receive updates for my posts, you may subscribe to the [atom feed](/atom.xml).

Life is daijoubu.
